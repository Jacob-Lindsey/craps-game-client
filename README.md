### Rules of the game

* **Pass Line**

  An even money bet, made on the first roll of the dice (known as the “come out roll”). You win if a 7 or 11 roll, or lose if 2, 3, or 12 roll (known as “craps”). Any other number that rolls becomes the “point” and the point must roll again before a 7 to win.

* **Don't Pass Line**
 
  An even money bet, which is the opposite of the pass line. You lose on the “come out” roll if the shooter rolls a 7 or 11. You win on a 2 or 3 (12 is a tie). Once a point is established, you lose if the point is thrown and win if a 7 rolls.

* **Come Bets**
 
  Made anytime after the first roll when a shooter has a point to make. You win on a 7 or 11 and lose on a 2, 3 or 12. Any other number becomes your “come point” and must be repeated for you to win before a 7 rolls.

* **Don't Come Bets**

  Made anytime after the first roll when a shooter has a point to make. It is the opposite of the come bet. You win if 2 or 3 roll (12 is a tie), and lose if 7 or 11 roll. Any other number rolled becomes your “come point” and if repeated you lose. If a 7 rolls you win.
  
* **Place Bets**

  Once a shooter makes a point, you may make a “place bet” on numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. If the shooter rolls any of these numbers before a 7, you win the following payoffs: 9 to 5 on 4 and 10, 7 to 5 on 5 and 9, and 7 to 6 on 6 and 8. A “place bet” may be taken off anytime before the next roll.

* **Field Bets**
  
  A one roll bet. You win even money on 3, 4, 9, 10 and 11. You win 2 to 1 on 2. You win 3 to 1 on 12. You lose on 5, 6, 7 or 8.

* **Proposition Bets**
  
  These bets are found in the center of the table and are one-roll bets. You are betting that on the very next roll of the dice any of these numbers will come up:

    * Any Craps (2, 3 or 12)	pays 8 for 1
    * Aces (2) or Twelve (12)	pays 31 for 1
    * Ace-Deuce (3) or Eleven (11)	pays 16 for 1
    * Seven (7)	pays 5 for 1

* **Hardaways**
  
  A Hardway bet is not a one-roll bet. You are betting that the shooter rolls a pair. Hardways win if the dice roll as a pair and lose if a 7 rolls or if the number is thrown “the easy way.” - **Example:** If you bet a hard 8 and thedice roll 4,4 you win. If the dice roll “easy” 5,3 or 6,2 you lose.
