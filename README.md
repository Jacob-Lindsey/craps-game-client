## In-browser Craps game

### Rules of the game

* Pass Line

..* An even money bet, made on the first roll of the dice (known as the “come out roll”). You win if a 7 or 11 roll, or lose if 2, 3, or 12 roll (known as “craps”). Any other number that rolls becomes the “point” and the point must roll again before a 7 to win.

* Don't Pass Line
 
..* An even money bet, which is the opposite of the pass line. You lose on the “come out” roll if the shooter rolls a 7 or 11. You win on a 2 or 3 (12 is a tie). Once a point is established, you lose if the point is thrown and win if a 7 rolls.

* Come Bets
 
..* Made anytime after the first roll when a shooter has a point to make. You win on a 7 or 11 and lose on a 2, 3 or 12. Any other number becomes your “come point” and must be repeated for you to win before a 7 rolls.

* Don't Come Bets

..* Made anytime after the first roll when a shooter has a point to make. It is the opposite of the come bet. You win if 2 or 3 roll (12 is a tie), and lose if 7 or 11 roll. Any other number rolled becomes your “come point” and if repeated you lose. If a 7 rolls you win.
